    "# Description\n",
    "In this stage, you need to add a new feature to the project â€” pick one name from the dictionary at random; this person's share will be paid by others. Make it a lucky day for somebody!\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you give your users a choice whether they want to use this feature or not. Don't turn it on by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random name, print it so that everyone knows who is the lucky one.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Objectives\n",
    "In this stage your program should perform the following steps together with the steps from the previous stages:\n",
    "```\n",
    "In case of an invalid number of people, \"No one is joining for the party\" is expected as an output;\n",
    "Otherwise, ask the user whether they want to use the \"Who is lucky?\" feature;\n",
    "Take input from the user;\n",
    "If a user wants to use the feature (Yes), choose a name from the dictionary keys at random and print the following: {Name} is the lucky one!;\n",
    "If the user enters anything else, print No one is going to be lucky.\n",
    "Do not print the output of the previous stage (see examples).\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Examples\n",
    "The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: The feature is used\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the number of friends joining (including you):\n",
    "> 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:\n",
    "> Marc\n",
    "> Jem\n",
    "> Monica\n",
    "> Anna\n",
    "> Jason\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the total bill value:\n",
    "> 100\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want to use the \"Who is lucky?\" feature? Write Yes/No:\n",
    "> Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "Jem is the lucky one!\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example 2: The feature is skipped\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the number of friends joining (including you):\n",
    "> 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the name of every friend (including you), each on a new line:\n",

    "> No\n",
    "\n",
    "No one is going to be lucky\n",

    "Example 3: Invalid input\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter the number of friends joining (including you):\n",
    "> 0\n",
